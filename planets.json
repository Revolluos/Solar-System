    "description": "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It experiences extreme temperature variations due to its lack of atmosphere. Despite being closest to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet - that distinction belongs to Venus. Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, similar to our Moon, indicating a history of impacts from asteroids and comets.",

It's the hottest planet in our solar system due to its thick atmosphere creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets, and a day on Venus is longer than its year.",

Our planet has a dynamic atmosphere that protects us from harmful solar radiation and maintains temperatures suitable for life. Earth's magnetic field, generated by its molten iron core, deflects charged particles from the solar wind. The presence of our Moon helps stabilize Earth's axial tilt and creates tides.",

Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water on its surface, and it may still have subsurface water ice. Mars has polar ice caps and experiences seasons due to its axial tilt similar to Earth's.",

Its Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Jupiter acts as a 'cosmic vacuum cleaner,' protecting inner planets from asteroids and comets with its strong gravitational pull. It has a faint ring system and at least 95 known moons, including the four Galilean moons discovered by Galileo.",

This ice giant was the first planet discovered through mathematical prediction rather than observation. Neptune's deep blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere. Its largest moon, Triton, orbits backwards and is likely a captured Kuiper Belt object. Neptune takes 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.",
